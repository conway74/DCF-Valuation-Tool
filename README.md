## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**DRIVER is a development methodology, not financial software.**

- This plugin provides a **workflow framework** for building tools — it does not execute trades, manage portfolios, or provide financial advice
- Any financial tools you build using DRIVER require **your own validation and testing**
- The authors assume **no liability** for financial decisions made using tools developed with this methodology
- This is **not investment advice** — consult qualified financial professionals for investment decisions
- Sample code and examples are for **educational purposes only**

**By using this plugin, you acknowledge that:**
1. You are responsible for validating any financial calculations in tools you build
2. You understand the risks of financial software development
3. You will not hold the authors liable for any financial losses

## What is DRIVER?

DRIVER guides you through six stages from concept to completion:

| Stage | Purpose | Iron Law |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **D**efine | Research what exists | No building without 分头研究 first |
| **R**epresent | Plan part by part | Don't reinvent what exists |
| **I**mplement | Build and run | Show don't tell |
| **V**alidate | Verify it works | Evidence before claims |
| **E**volve | Package deliverable | Self-contained export |
| **R**eflect | Capture learnings | Document what didn't work |

## The Philosophy

**AI is not a tool you command — it's a thinking partner.**

- **You bring**: vision, domain expertise, judgment
- **AI brings**: patterns, research ability, heavy lifting on code
- **Neither creates alone** — meaning emerges from interaction

## Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/CinderZhang/driver-plugin
/plugin install driver@driver-plugin
```

Restart Claude Code after installing.

### From Local Folder (For Development)

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/driver-plugin
/plugin install driver@driver-dev
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project directory
claude

# Initialize a DRIVER project
/driver:init

# Check available commands
/driver:help

# Begin with research and definition
/driver:define
```

---

## Next Step

### How to Run

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

1.  **Open Terminal** in this folder.
2.  **Run the App**:
    ```powershell
    # Ensure uv is in path (temporary)
    $env:Path = "C:\Users\Eleanor Conway\.local\bin;$env:Path"
    
    # Run
    uv run streamlit run src/app.py
    ```
2.  The app will open automatically in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Workflow

1. `/driver:define` — Establish vision, research what exists (开题调研)

| `/driver:represent-section` | Spec a section |

### IMPLEMENT Stage
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/driver:implement-data` | Create sample data |
| `/driver:implement-screen` | Build and run code |

### VALIDATE Stage
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|

## For Quant/Finance Work

DRIVER recommends **Python + Streamlit** over TypeScript/React for analytical tools:

```
UI:           Streamlit (or Dash/Panel)
Backend:      FastAPI + Pydantic
Calculations: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
Finance:      numpy-financial, QuantLib
Data:         financialdatasets.ai, Bloomberg, Refinitiv (recommended)
              yfinance, FRED (free alternatives - use at own risk)
```

**Why Python?**
- NumPy handles edge cases (safe division, vectorized ops)
- Pydantic validates inputs at boundaries
- No npm complexity, no TypeScript type juggling
- Better finance libraries

## Example Projects

| Project Type | Key Libraries | Data Source | Reference |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| DCF Valuation | numpy-financial | financialdatasets.ai | Damodaran |
| Portfolio Optimization | PyPortfolioOpt, cvxpy | Professional data feed | Markowitz |
| Factor Research | alphalens, statsmodels | WRDS, CRSP | Open Source Asset Pricing |
| Risk Analytics | scipy.stats, VaR/CVaR | Professional data feed | RiskMetrics |
| Data Pipeline | pandas, great_expectations | Multiple sources | ETL patterns |

> **Data Sources:** For reliable results, use professional data providers (financialdatasets.ai, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, FactSet). Free sources like yfinance may have gaps, delays, or inaccuracies.
